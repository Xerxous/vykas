### 120 - Wing folds
Eat ONLY ONE orb per person and gather in the center
- Purple majority: 2 folded -> 1 folded -> Unfolded
- Red majority: Unfolded -> 1 folded -> 2 folded
NOTE: 11o'clock usually 1 folded, if not, it's 3o'clock (might be positioned at 1o'clock)
### 64 1/2 - Red and Black orbs
- After pulses, type "<pos> (R|B){5}" ex, "5 RBRRB"
- Move spares accordingly (if 3B, spares go there)
- You can timestop 2 consecutive OR panacea to take one more
- If you take red or 2 black orbs with debuff, you die
## Normal mechanics - Big attacks
### Lasers
- Move apart and traffic rotation
### Purple Ring
- If ring is above your head, move away from party (ping ring position) and take it (inside safe) once your party is safe

- When Vykas has Less than 50 lines, Purple pool is activated if you get hit by 3 attacks (works like lugaru bleed stacks)
